            <p class="lead">The AirBnB Home Office is a new business segment that leverages the existing "Home away  from home" community that AirBnB has built as an organization. This relationship has established trust and we felt the Home Office booking would be easily integrated into their existing business model, since the infrastructure already exist.</p>

                We collected quantitative and qualitative <br>data by performing 6 one-on-one interviews <br>and surveying 20 people through Facebook <br>surveys.<br><br>

<b>3 important questions</b><br>
<br>

1. How could we help people  who donâ€™t<br> have an ideal condition to work at home, <br>find a convenient office space?<br>
<br>
2. How could Airbnb provide a more <br>productive work space for its users?<br><br>

3. How could Airbnb accelerate from being <br>mainly a bed and bath solution, to solving <br>other problems, such as the need for <br>convenient work space?

<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
<br>

As a result of the pandemic, working from<br> home has become the new normal. This has<br>resulted, in individuals having a hard time<br>
adapting. Challenges such as distractions<br>and a volitile working culture contributes to<br> the need for external spaces that enable <br>collaboration to meet the ever changing <br>demands of the world of work and study.<br>
 <br>How might we provide practical, convenient<br>and fresh solutions and opportunities for <br> individuals struggling to work from home to<br>achieve their work/study goals?

            We used the "I Like, I Wish, What If" method <br>in order to ideate possible solutions to help <br>our users achieve their goals and needs as <br>well as minimize their problems .<br><br>

            After discussing and voting in  the I like, I<br>

            wish and what  if stage, we created  the <br> feature prioritization  matrix which helped <br>us come up with specific features such <br>specific filters, discount deals, and unique<br>
            offices which you will see in the prototypes. <br><br>

            Having foung good enough solutions we <br>decided to create a storyboard to give out <br>solution a personality.

                We started by sketching the user flow from opening the airbnb app to booking a home office to a complete. We wanted to give user the ability to choose from a list of home offices that they searched for, as well as finding unique offices and vip deals.

From there we each sketched our own ideas into paper wireframes. We believe this is a really productive method as we can quickly sketch our ideas and iterate. We voted on the wireframes that worked best with our feature on Airbnb and moved on to sketching low-fidelity digital wireframes.<br> <br>
After a few rounds of testing, we made some iterations based on the feedback we recieved. 
Here are the changes and final look! <br> <br>
1. We made our feature product the center of the homepage as Airbnb usally does with every new feature they offer. This way the user is able to spot it sooner and click on it to find out more. 

2. We maximized the use of white space by cleaning up the information the user actually needed to see.

3. We cleaned up the layout and made it more presentable to the user and familiar with what they usally see on Airbnb. We also added "Payment methods" as a way to speed up the booking process for users who have booked other stay with Airbnb in the past.
